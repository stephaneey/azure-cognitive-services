# azure-cognitive-services

Before trying this example in your own environment, make sure to:

- Create a Yammer App (https://www.yammer.com/client_applications) with a verified admin account, in order to obtain an Access Token you'll
specify in the app.config
- Have a Yammer group with > 100 conversations of genuine content (not things like "I hate potatoes" "I love potatoes etc.).
For instance, for this test, I created a group with random content coming from Wikipedia.
- Configure the Computer Vision and Text Analytics APIs in your Azure Tenant (they both come with a free plan), in order to get the 
subscription keys you'll specify in the app.config
